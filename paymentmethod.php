        <p>Our shop exclusively accepts Cash on Delivery (COD) as the payment method. Customers pay for their items upon receiving them, ensuring security and trust in our products. Items purchased through COD are delivered within 7 days, providing a convenient and secure shopping experience.</p>
        <p>Customers can inspect their packages upon arrival. If there are any issues, our shop offers a cash back guarantee for unsatisfied customers. With COD, there's no need for upfront payments or bank transfers, making it ideal for those without access to online banking. However, please ensure someone is available to receive and pay for the delivery on time.</p>
        <p>Cash on Delivery (COD) is a widely adopted payment method due to its simplicity and reliability. It allows customers to make purchases without the need for a credit card or online payment system. This method is particularly beneficial for those who are not comfortable with sharing their financial information online or do not have access to digital payment methods. By choosing COD, customers can feel more secure knowing that they only need to pay once they have received their items.</p>
        <p>One of the main advantages of COD is the added layer of security it provides. Since the payment is made at the time of delivery, customers can verify the condition of their items before handing over the money. This reduces the risk of fraud and ensures that customers are satisfied with their purchase. Additionally, COD helps to build trust between the retailer and the customer, as it demonstrates the retailer's confidence in their products and services.</p>
